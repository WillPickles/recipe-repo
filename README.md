## About Recipe Repo

Recipe Repo (The name could change) is a place to store recipes with the view to making shopping and meal planning easier in the long run. 

I came up with the idea from personal experience. Me and Jess often buy a new cookbook or look through other peoples cookbooks and find lots of recipes that sound good. We started making a note when we found good recipes but it was very basic and always meant getting the book back out. I wanted a place to be able to add recipes when we see them, ideally just by taking a picture of them. I also wanted to be able to generate 5 or 7 random recipes so that there was no thinking involved in what meals we would eat each week.
